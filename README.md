**ML-Projects**

Welcome to the ML-Projects repository! Here you'll find a collection of projects focused on data analysis, data cleaning, feature engineering, and model predictions. These projects leverage datasets sourced from Kaggle, a platform known for its diverse range of datasets and competitions.

### Projects Overview:

1. **titanic_EDA.ipynb**
   - This project revolves around the classic Titanic dataset available on Kaggle. It explores exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques to understand the dataset's structure, distributions, and relationships between variables. Additionally, it delves into data cleaning processes to prepare the dataset for modeling. The ultimate goal is to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster or not, making it a binary classification problem.

2. **Spaceship titanic - Feature Engineering Focused.ipynb**
   - In this project, we introduce a futuristic twist to the Titanic dataset by imagining a scenario where a spaceship, analogous to the Titanic, disappears in the future. Similar to the first project, the focus lies on feature engineering techniques, where we manipulate and create new features from the existing data to enhance predictive performance. The prediction task remains binary: determining whether an individual survived or not.

### Libraries Used:
- **NumPy**: For numerical computing and array operations.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization and plotting.
- **Seaborn**: For statistical data visualization, complementing Matplotlib.
- **Scikit-learn (sklearn)**: For machine learning algorithms, model building, and evaluation.

### How to Use:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/your_username/ML-Projects.git`.
2. Open the Jupyter notebooks (`*.ipynb` files) using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
3. Follow along with the code and comments within each notebook.
4. Execute the code cells to see the analysis, data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model predictions in action.
5. Feel free to experiment with the code, modify parameters, or try different models to deepen your understanding.
